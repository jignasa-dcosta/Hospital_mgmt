# Hospital Management System

## Project Overview

The **Hospital Management System** is a Django-based web application designed to help patients manage their appointments, diagnosis, prescriptions, and appointment history. The goal of this system is to reduce the stress of handling physical files by allowing patients and healthcare professionals to access all relevant information online in an organized and efficient manner.

This project allows:
- Patients to book appointments with doctors.
- View their diagnosis and prescriptions.
- Track their appointment history.
- Improve the overall management of patient-related data for hospital staff.

By providing an online platform to store and retrieve patient information, this system simplifies the hospital management process and ensures a more seamless experience for both patients and healthcare professionals.
